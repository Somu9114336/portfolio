          Greetings!
          My name is somanatha sahoo, and I am delighted to introduce myself as a recent
          graduate from Khallikote Unitary University, where I completed my post-graduation
          studies. Prior to that, I earned my bachelor's degree from Udayanath College of
          Science and Technology, building a strong foundation in BCA(Bachelor in Computer Application). My academic journey began at Prachi Academy, Adaspur, Cuttack, where I
          completed my schooling. Each educational institution has played a pivotal role in
          shaping my academic and personal growth, fostering in me a deep appreciation for
          learning and a commitment to excellence. I am grateful for the opportunities and
          knowledge I have gained throughout my educational journey and am eager to apply my
          skills and insights as I embark on the next chapter of my career.
        </p>

          I'm thrilled to
          embark on my journey in the dynamic world of Information Technology .
